      In Alibaba Cloud, a disk can only be encrypted at the time of disk creation.
      Please create a new Elastic Compute Service (ECS) instance with all encrypted disks, from an image of the instance with unencrypted disks.
      Note: Before running the following steps, please ensure that the teams responsible for the instance and disk are aware of this activity to avoid any outage.
      1. Log in to Alibaba Cloud Portal.
      2. Go to Elastic Compute Service (or search for Elastic Compute Service in the search bar).
      3. In Instances, search for the ECS instance with unencrypted system or data disks. 
          a. Click on 3 dots (...) and select Create Custom Image.
      4. In Images, search for the newly created custom image and click Create Instances.
          a. While creating the new instance with attached disks from image, select Encryption to encrypt each disk.
      5. Once successfully created the new ECS instance with encrypted disks, verify all data are perfectly backed up.
      6. Release the ECS instance with unencrypted disks. Delete the newly created custom image if not required.
    terraform_remediation: |
      1. Use the following Terraform code to create a custom ECS image:

          ...

      2. Use the following Terraform code to create a new ECS instance with encrypted disks from the image:
        resource "alicloud_instance" "example_instance" {
          image_id              = alicloud_image.example_image.id

      After a load balancer listener has been created, the protocol cannot be changed.
      Please create a new HTTPS listener with the correct TLS security policy and delete the existing HTTP listener.
      1. Log in to Alibaba Cloud Portal.
      2. Go to Server Load Balancer (or search for Server Load Balancer in the search bar).
      3. Locate the load balancer with the reported listener > Click on the load balancer name/ID.
      4. In Listener tab, click Add Listener. While creating the new listener, select the following options:
          a. In Protocol and Listener section, select Listener Protocol as HTTPS.
          b. In SSL Certificates section, select TLS Security Policy as a policy that supports the correct TLS version.
      5. Verify the new HTTPS listener is working. Delete the existing Listener.
          a. In Listener tab, select the existing listener > Click More > Click Remove > Click OK.

      1. Use the following Terraform code to create a new HTTPS listener with security policy:
        a. Classic Load Balancer listener
          resource "alicloud_slb_listener" "example_slb_listener" {
            protocol          = "https"
            tls_cipher_policy = <Policy with the correct TLS version>
            ...
          }
        b. Application Load Balancer listener
          resource "alicloud_alb_security_policy" "example_alb_sec_policy" {
            security_policy_name = "tf_example"
            tls_versions         = <Correct TLS versions>
            ...
          }
          resource "alicloud_alb_listener" "example_alb_listener" {
            listener_protocol  = "HTTPS"
            security_policy_id = alicloud_alb_security_policy.example_alb_sec_policy.id
            ...
          }
      2. Remove the listener resource with incorrect TLS version.

    remediation_steps: |
      1. Log in to Alibaba Cloud Portal.
      2. Go to ApsaraDB RDS (or search for ApsaraDB in the search bar).
      3. In Instances, click the reported ApsaraDB RDS instance using default VPC.
      4. In Database Connection, click Switch vSwitch.
      5. Select a non-default VPC and vSwitch > Click OK.
    terraform_remediation: |
      1. Use the following Terraform code to assign a vSwitch from a non-default VPC for the ApsaraDB RDS instance:
        resource "alicloud_db_instance" "example_db" {
          vswitch_id = <ID of vSwitch from a non-default VPC>
          ...
        }
