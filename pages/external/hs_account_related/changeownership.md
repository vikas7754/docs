To change the ownership of any hyperscaler account, you need to open a ticket in Multi-Cloud's SNOW (Service Now Ticketing) system.

We need an approval from the old and new owner, so I recommend the current owner to open this ticket.

Go to Our Service Desk in ServiceNow and click on "GCS Hyperscalers Management"

Select "Hyperscaler Account & User Management"

![snow_co_2](/assets/docs-images/Weekly_Reporting_eMail_KB/snow_co_2.png)

Select "GCS - Hyperscaler - Manage Users"

Please select which Hyperscaler holds the account/subscription/project in question:

On the next line, select the change in ownership of the account in question:

Now fill in the needed informations.

If you are NOT the actual owner, please provide an approval from the current owner. If the current owner is not available anymore (left the company) please state this in the details and provide an approval from the responsible manager.

Don't forget to upload the approval (if needed):

The change should be done in about 24 to 48 hours.
