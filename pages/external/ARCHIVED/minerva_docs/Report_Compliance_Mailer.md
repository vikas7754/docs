# Hyperscaler Compliance Report Mailer

The Hyperscaler Compliance Report Mailer is a feature for sharing Minerva compliance data to relevant persons via email. All technical responsible users and security officers of existing accounts will get emails regarding their accounts. Emails are sent every Monday.

The email will contain an aggregated report of all violations and alerts for the accounts associated with the recipient (Technical Responsible User (TRU) or Security Officer (SO)). The excel file that is attached to the email, contains a more detailed breakdown of the accounts' associated violations and alerts.
