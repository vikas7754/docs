# Prisma Cloud

Prisma Cloud is a Configuration Compliance, and security monitoring tool for use in AWS, Azure, GCP, and soon AliCloud. Configuration Compliance means that it is constantly monitoring your public cloud account for "best practice" and "most secure" configurations of your services and instances. Prisma Cloud is NOT a vulnerability scanner. It is not aware of things like patch level of your instances. However, it does know whether you have created an S3 bucket with public access, or if IAM users are not using MFA. These alerts are classified into "High Risk", "Medium Risk" and "Low Risk".
