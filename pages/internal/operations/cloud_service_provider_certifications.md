# Cloud Service Provider Certifications: Administrative Tasks 

***An additional JIRA request type is being added under Additional_Services/Security/Cloud_Service_Provider_Certification***

## Overview

To make things more organized, accessible and secure, we have migrated our Security compliance reports repository to our Hyperscaler DevSecOps TeamSharepoint. In order to obtain the Cloud Service Provider security compliance reports, please use the followinglink:

- [Cloud Service Provider Certifications](https://sap.sharepoint.com/teams/MC-DevSecOps/Shared%20Documents/Forms/AllItems.aspx?viewid=e313cb5f%2Da2de%2D4394%2D81b0%2Df3b6e8a42020&id=%2Fteams%2FMC%2DDevSecOps%2FShared%20Documents%2FCloud%20Service%20Provider%20Certifications "Cloud Service Provider Certifications")

**NOTE:** These documents are **CONFIDENTIAL** for Internal SAP employees and contractors only. They are **NOT** to be redistributed outside of SAP. These reports contain highly confidential cloud service providers'data. Violation of their security compliance report policies like unauthorized redistribution might be regarded as a breach of SAP\'s SLAs with them. In order to obtain more information users can be directed to our Multi-Cloud Operation\'s ServiceDesk portal (https://servicedesk.multicloud.int.sap) to put in a request. If necessary, they can also reach out through mail to any the following individuals from our team.

## Prerequisites For Access

Recently, SGS requested us to create a more formal format in Service Desk for requesting access to these reports:

- Content of the Request:
- Customer Name
- Optional: Opportunity ID
- Reason for Requesting
- Sign NDA yes/no
- Hyperscaler
- Which report is requested?
- (Optional) - GSIM Ticket number (SGS CISA Ticket system)

## User Guidelines 

1. Reports are for strict internal use only!

3. The User Instructions are general reports usage guidance based on our SLA/NDA with public cloud providers.

5. Details on how to access certain reports (GCP are password protected) are provided within the GCP report\'s directory. These reports are part of security compliance, so everyone should be able to access it on purpose.

7. All the cloud provider relevant reports and bridge letters are collected as per their availability. 

9. Our team tracks these reports on requests. We organize them for tracking access and responsibly providing easy access to information. Nothing stringent!
