# Guide for Service Now ticketing system

This guide outlines salient Service Now (aka SNOW) information specific to the GCS HSEO team. More general information about Service Now can be found under the [GCS Cloud Core Enablement Sharepoint](https://sap.sharepoint.com/sites/121309/CloudCoreEnablement/SitePages/ServiceNow-learning-Resources.aspx "GCS Cloud Core Enablement Sharepoint").

The guide covers the following areas:

1. Creating a Service Now account.
2. Managing Service Now notifications.
3. How to forward tickets to other teams.

### _Creating a Service Now account_

To create a Service Now account, follow the steps in the guide for creating _Individual access requests to ServiceNow_ found in [User Instruction on How to Request Authorization to ServiceNow Instances](https://workzone.one.int.sap/site#workzone-home&/groups/PPE8Am1JUbihkc5Hz5ZTrV/documents/idecpIkvyRqoqZ6xrU2dme/slide_viewer "User Instruction on How to Request Authorization to ServiceNow Instances").
Once you have completed this, you will need to add the following Service Team groups to your account:

_GCS Response Operations Teams_  
_GCS L3 Security_

To add the Service Team groups, go to [ITSM](https://itsm.services.sap) and follow the steps in [Request and Approval of access](https://jam4.sapjam.com/groups/MBasO4CV8AVQt67aSpoZOz/documents/b4Q23Nvy37AZ7IJjLbuyNg/slide_viewer?_lightbox=true).
If you cannot find the aforementioned groups or you get an error message when trying to add the group, raise an IT ticket to get access through the [Unified Ticketing System](https://fiorilaunchpad.sap.com/sites#Shell-home).

### _Managing Service Now notifications_

To manage Service Now notifications, go to [ITSM](https://itsm.services.sap) and follow the steps in [Internal Mail Notifications guide](https://jam4.sapjam.com/groups/MBasO4CV8AVQt67aSpoZOz/documents/rcW2TzZcI2RQPRefalhycY/slide_viewer). The steps are on pages 18/19 and the guide also describes the different notifications.

### _Forwarding tickets to other teams_

Tickets may be allocated to the team that need to be forwarded to other teams. The process for doing this is to identify the correct team to send it to and change the assignment group. An overview of the roles of the GCS team roles can be found [GCS Components Service Offerings](https://jam4.sapjam.com/groups/MBasO4CV8AVQt67aSpoZOz/documents/v5PKB8fpEZ6DVVzgLBEFAE/slide_viewer?_lightbox=true).

Once you have found the correct team to forward the ticket to, from the _Details_ tab of the ticket, click on _Assignment group_ to change the appropriate team:
