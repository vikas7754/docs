# Orca Ops Runbook - Service Overview
This is the Orca Ops Runbook (aka Admin guide).

## Orca Service Overview
Orca is a SaaS-based, Cloud-Native Application Protection Platform (CNAPP) that scans SAP cloud estates for security risks/compromises and assets. It uses an innovative non-intrusive solution for cloud scanning known as “side-scanning”, which involves taking snapshots of running instances using the cloud provider's native cloud API. This means that cloud assets do not need anything installed for Orca to scan them.

## What is Orca project?
The Orca project involves using Orca to support resource and software asset management, including virtual machines and containers. It is also customised with security compliance scanning controls based on [SGS (SAP Global Security) Hardening guidelines](https://wiki.wdf.sap.corp/wiki/x/1CWZc) to provide centralised reporting on the security compliance posture of SAP cloud accounts.

The scope for Orca is all public cloud accounts in SAP. It does not provide coverage for Converged Cloud.
